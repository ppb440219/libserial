This project is a CMake-based implementation that simplifies serial port operations in a c++ class for easy data transfer and reception.

I created this project with the intention of enabling seamless integration of serial port communication into other projects. The main program as an example to illustrate the usage of the library.

The project was built using Visual Studio 2022, but it should be easily integrated with other projects because it is a CMake-based project.
